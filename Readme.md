# Memory Game

This will be my first, simple memory game. It will be developed piece by piece, probably with a lot of mistakes. In order to create it I have to learn a lot really fast. I love such challenges!

## Why I code?
As a child, I wrote programs for my *LEGO* robots in *NQC* using *Ubuntu*. In high school, the class involved a bit of writing in *Pascal* and creating simple *HTML* pages. Living in a small town in Podhale led me professionally in a different direction, but technologies have always been close to me. This year, while looking for professional development opportunities for myself, I took an automation tester course and rediscovered programming. I fell in love and I want to combine that childhood joy of writing programs with the ability to focus and motivate, which is typical of an adult. Along with the new opportunities offered by living in a big city, I plan to build a new career and experience a great adventure.
